Final project for CMSC417 - Computer Networks

I just recently rediscovered my code for this project so I don't exactly remember how to run it, 
but when I figure it out, I'll update the README with instructions.

Keep in mind, I wrote this in about a week by myself, so some things such as writing to disk, requesting blocks, etc. are not optimized at all and lead to very suboptimal performance.
